# Lab Report 5 - Salman Navroz 

## Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario

### 1. Student Post

Hello, I am struggling with getting the test class to run with JUnit for my grading script. The error states `Error: Could not find or load main class org.junit.runner.JUnitCore
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.junit.runner.JUnitCore`. This is confusing to me because I used the same path for `lib` that we have always used in class to access and run Junit tests and I can see `lib` in my project directory, but it is still giving me this error. Is the problem potentially because my script runs `cd` into the `grading-area` directory which does not contain the `lib` directory as a subdirectory?

### 2. TA Response

Yes, you are correct that the `lib` directory is not a subdirectory in the grading-area directory which is most likely why you are getting the error that the JUnit class cannot be found. Think about how `..` and `../` can be used to access files from the parent directory of a directory. What is the path of the `lib` directory relative to the `grading-area` directory? Try using the relative path of `lib`.

### 3. Student Bug Fix Result

The bug is that the path used for the `lib` directory which is needed to run the JUnit classes which are needed for the `TestListExamples` class is accessing a `lib` directory from the current directory. There is no `lib` directory in the `grading-area` directory, so this is the wrong path.

### 4. Setup

- Directory Structure:

- File Contents Before Bug Fix

  `TestListExamples.java`:

  `grade.sh`:

- The command run inside the grade.sh file that triggered the bug was `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples | grep -m 1 -A1 "JUnit" > results.txt`. The command ran to run `grade.sh` with the student's repository url that needed to be graded was `bash grade.sh https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected`.
 
- The actual `lib` directory is inside the parent directory (the project directory, `list-examples-grader`), so we need to put a ../ before the path to go back one directory into the parent directory to access the correct `lib` directory. The correct path is now `../lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:../lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:.` which allows the grading script to succesfully run JUnit and the whole script as a whole becuase it succesfully accesses the hamcrest-core-1.3.jar and junit-4.13.2.jar files from the correct `lib` directory.  

## Part 2 - Reflection

One thing I learned from my lab experience was how to use vim. I learned many commands that are needed to properly use vim and that vim is a good tool to use if you want to edit a file directly from the command line or if you do not have access to a file editor application (e.g., when accessing a remote computer file).
