# Lab Report 1 - Salman Navroz
## cd examples
1. No arguments ![Image](EX1.png)
* The working directory when the command was run was the root directory.
* There was no output because there was no argument/directory given for the cd command to move into. Therefore, the command did not do anything and stayed in the root directory. Based on other tests the cd command with no arguments makes the working directory the root directory.
